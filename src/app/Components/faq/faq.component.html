        Welcome to CSGOWizard! On this page you can find answers to common questions
        about our site. If you're looking for personal help, please visit our support page.

      <h4>Wait, what is this thing again?</h4>
      <p class="tos-p">This is a skin site called CSGOWizard. We make it easy for
        people to win Counter-Strike: Global Offensive skins by playing 1v1 coinflip matches.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>How does it work?</h4>
      <p class="tos-p">Sign in through Steam and deposit a skin. Pick a game, and choose which side of the coin you think will win; Terrorist or Counter Terrorist.
        If the coin lands on the side you chose, you win double!
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>So, how much can I win?</h4>
      <p class="tos-p">
        You can play for 1.00 or go big for 10,000. We see games in the 1,000+ range happening
        every day.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>What are emeralds?</h4>
      <p class="tos-p">
        When you deposit a skin, we'll figure out how much it's worth on our market, and give you the corresponding number of emeralds.
        <br>
        Use emeralds to join games or buy skins on CSGOWizard.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Someone added me on Steam, is it you?</h4>
      <p class="tos-p">
        Nope. Our admins, support staff or bots will <u><b>never</b></u> add you on Steam.
        Whoever added you is probably up to no good. Please <a href="#" style="color: #3EEA6F !important;">join our official group</a> and view our <a href="#" style="color: #3EEA6F !important;">official bots</a>.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Do you do sponsorships?</h4>
      <p class="tos-p">
        We sure do. If you have a strong following on a social network, Youtube or Twitch please fill out our
        <a style="color: #3EEA6F !important;" class="typeform-share" href="#" data-mode="2" target="_blank">sponsorship application</a>.

      <h4>Is there a secret to improve my chance of winning?</h4>
      <p class="tos-p">
        First, we need to cover some things that donâ€™t work.
        Swinging your monitor above your head and wishing for the coin to land on Terrorist does NOT work.
        There is no improvement to be had by swinging your monitor while yelling "gaben please". Although we have not tested it, setting your desktop background to an image of KennyS is not likely to work either.
        It is also no good to follow the alignment of the planets or something similar. Any of these ideas will win, sometimes.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>What's the difference between gross and net profits?</h4>
      <p class="tos-p">
        Gross profits are how many emeralds you won. Net profits are how many
        emeralds you won, minus the tax we took for every 1v1 played.
      </p>
      <br>
